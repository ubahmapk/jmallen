My name is [Jon Mark Allen](https://keybase.io/ubahmapk) and I've been a [geek](https://geekcabi.net) most of my life.

But this site isn't necessarily about anything geeky. Just a place to put random thoughts, from geek, to Christianity, to SciFi, to baseball (in particular the 2023 World Champion Texas Rangers), to.... whatever.

I'm on the social medias, but not super active. I don't find most of the conversation fruitful and I don't contribute much there. I'd rather sit down to talk over a coffee - or a full breakfast!
