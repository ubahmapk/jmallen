Recently, the science/education YouTube channel [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium)[^1], run by Derek Muller, published a video titled "What the Longest-Running Study on Happiness Reveals" with a subtitle of "How to lead a happier, healthier and longer life".

Derek frequently begins videos by asking strangers on the street a question related to the video. Not surprisingly, many of the people he talked to for this episode (not included in the study) first said something about money leading to happiness. But the video did an excellent job empirically showing that money does not, generally, make people happier (beyond a certain point).

The overall conclusion was that good relationships make the largest contribution to overall happiness. Which is something Christians see in the very beginning of the Bible:

{{< bibleref reference="[Genesis 2.18 (ESV)](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Gen2.18)" >}}
18 Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him."
{{< /bibleref >}}

But Scripture tells us there's so much more than happiness available. Above and beyond putting our hope for happiness in the hands of those around us - who could never bear the weight of that hope. Our hope for happiness is in relationship, yes. But in relationshiop with the Creator God of the Universe who loves us. Who does not change. Who, alone, is able to bear the weight of our hope.

{{< bibleref reference="[Psalms 4.6-8 (ESV)](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ps4.6-8)" >}}
6 There are many who say, “Who will show us some good?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!”<br/>
7 You have put more joy in my heart<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than they have when their grain and wine abound.<br/>
8 In peace I will both lie down and sleep;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.
{{< /bibleref >}}

{{< bibleref reference="[Psalms 1.1-3 (ESV)](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ps1.1-3)" >}}
1 Blessed is the man<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nor stands in the way of sinners,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor sits in the seat of scoffers;<br/>
2 but his delight is in the law of the LORD,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on his law he meditates day and night.<br/>
3 He is like a tree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planted by streams of water<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that yields its fruit in its season,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its leaf does not wither.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all that he does, he prospers.<br/>
{{< /bibleref >}}

What's more, our joy is not just for right now, but rooted in eternity.

{{< bibleref reference="[John 16.20-22](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jn16.20-22)" >}}
20 Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. 21 When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. 22 So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you
{{< /bibleref >}}

This is another example where science continues to line up with what Scripture has told us all along. Which is expected, since both have the same author.
