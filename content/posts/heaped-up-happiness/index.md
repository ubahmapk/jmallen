Everywhere I go of late, it seems the topic of joy vs happiness is coming up.

Even last night at the high school, there was a senior thesis presentation that discussed the importance of finding a meaning in life vs a life of distraction, as illustrated in the book "[Farenheit 451](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451)" by Ray Bradbury. 

And the other day I came across a prayer from Thomas Brooks, titled "Heaped up Happiness", that I felt was worth sharing.

> Lord God, you are glorious and happy in yourself<br/>
> and you make glorious and happy<br/>
> &nbsp;those who enjoy you as their portion.<br/>
> All the blessing of the people of God stands in this:<br/>
> &nbsp;you are our God,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;you are our portion,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you are our inheritance.<br/>
> Oh, the heaped up happiness<br/>
> &nbsp;of those whose God is the Lord;<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;a happiness so great and so glorious,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;it cannot be conceived, and cannot be uttered!<br/>
> All the blessing of this world cannot make us happy,<br/>
> &nbsp;except we have you to boot.<br/>
> &nbsp;<br/>
> Nothing can make us truly miserable<br/>
> &nbsp;when you are our portion,<br/>
> and nothing can make someone truly happy<br/>
> &nbsp;when you are not their portion.<br/>
> You are the author of all true happiness;<br/>
> &nbsp;the donor of all true happiness;<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;the maintainer of all true happiness,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the centre of all true happiness and blessing.<br/>
> &nbsp;<br/>
> Lord God, you are a treasure no one can take from us.<br/>
> No friend, no foe, no devil can ever rob us of you.<br/>
> You are ours by convenant,<br/>
> &nbsp;ours by promise,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;ours by purchase,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ours by conquest,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ours by donation,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ours by marriage,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ours by the pledge of the Spirit,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ours by the witness of the Spirit.<br/>
> You are not only our God for the present,<br/>
> &nbsp;you are not only our God for the near future:<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;you will be our God for ever and ever.<br/>
> Only a power that can out-match your power<br/>
> &nbsp;and a strength above your strength<br/>
> &nbsp;could rob or ruin our share in you.<br/>
> But who is there who is stronger than you?<br/>
> Is the clay stronger than the potter<br/>
> &nbsp;or the stubble than the flame<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;or weakness than strength?<br/>
> No, for your weakness is stronger than any human power.<br/>
> We may easily be deprived of our earthly treasure.<br/>
> Many have lost treasures<br/>
> &nbsp;by stomrs at sea,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;by force and violence,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by fraud and deceit,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by hideous lying and hellish swearing.<br/>
> &nbsp;<br/>
> But you are a portion that the fire cannot burn,<br/>
> &nbsp;that the floods cannot drown,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;that the theif cannot steal,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the enemy cannot commandeer,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the soldier cannot plunder.<br/>
> Someone may take my gold from me,<br/>
> &nbsp;but no one can take you form me.<br/>
> Until weakness can make a breach upon strength,<br/>
> &nbsp;impotence upon omnipotence,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;the pitcher upon the potter,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the crawling worm upon you,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord of hosts,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;a saint's portion is safe and secure.<br/>
> Sickness may take my health and strength,<br/>
> &nbsp;death may take my friends and my relations,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;enemies may take my estate and my liberty.<br/>
> But none can take you, my God, from me.<br/>
> You are nailed to your people<br/>
> &nbsp;by your everlasting love,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;by your everlasting covenant,<br/>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the blood of your Son.<br/>
