At some point, we've all said (or at least **heard** it said), "I'll do that when I get around to it".

Today our church home group is having a White Elephant Christmas gift exchange, but with a rule twist: What is brought cannot be bought, but must already exist in your home OR you can make something.

So, I took advantage of the maker space at our library and made a round "Tuit":

{{% figure src="a-round-tuit-side-01.webp" caption="Just what you've been waiting for!" alt="Round wooden chip, a \"round tuit\""%}}
{{% figure src="a-round-tuit-side-02.webp" alt="This is a round tuit. It is especially hard to come by, so guard it with your life. It will help you become a much more efficient worker. For years, you've heard people say &quot;I'll do it when I get a round tuit.&quot; Now that you have one, you can accomplish all those things you put aside until you got your round tuit." alt="Back side of same round tuit" %}}

The back of the tuit says:

> This is a round tuit.
> It is especially hard to come by, so guard it with your life.
> It will help you become a much more efficient worker.
> For years, you've heard people say "I'll do it when I get a round tuit."
> 
> Now that you have one, you can accomplish all those things you put aside until you got your round tuit.

Whoever gets this is going to have a major increase in productivity this year, lemme tell ya! 😆️
