At some point, we've all said (or at least **heard** it said), "I'll do that when I get around to it".

Today our church home group is having a White Elephant Christmas gift exchange, but with a rule twist: What is brought cannot be bought, but must already exist in your home OR you can make something.

So, I took advantage of the maker space at our library and made a round "Tuit":

{{% figure src="2023-12-16-a-round-tuit-side-01.png" caption="Just what you've been waiting for!" %}}
{{% figure src="2023-12-16-a-round-tuit-side-02.png" %}}

Whoever gets this is going to have a major increase in productivity this year, lemme tell ya! üòÜÔ∏è
