{{< bibleref reference="[Deuteronomy 25:11â€“12 (ESV)](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Deuteronomy25.11â€“12)" >}}
11Â â€œWhen men fight with one another and the wife of the one draws near to rescue her husband from the hand of him who is beating him and puts out her hand and seizes him by the private parts, 12Â then you shall cut off her hand. Your eye shall have no pity.
