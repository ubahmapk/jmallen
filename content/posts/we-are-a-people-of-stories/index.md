I noticed this morning another instance where God accounted for our ability to forget His goodness, and built into his design a rythm of remembrance:

{{< bibleref reference="[Deuteronomy 26:1–11 (CSB)](https://biblia.com/books/csb/Deuteronomy26.1–11)" >}}
1 "When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it and live in it, 2 take some of the first of all the land’s produce that you harvest from the land the LORD your God is giving you and put it in a basket. Then go to the place where the LORD your God chooses to have his name dwell. 3 When you come before the priest who is serving at that time, say to him, ‘Today I declare to the LORD your God that I have entered the land the LORD swore to our ancestors to give us.’ 
4 "Then the priest will take the basket from you and place it before the altar of the LORD your God. 5 You are to respond by saying in the presence of the LORD your God: 

My father was a wandering Aramean. He went down to Egypt with a few people and resided there as an alien. There he became a great, powerful, and populous nation. 6 But the Egyptians mistreated and oppressed us, and forced us to do hard labor. 7 So we called out to the LORD, the God of our ancestors, and the LORD heard our cry and saw our misery, hardship, and oppression. 8 Then the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, with terrifying power, and with signs and wonders. 9 He led us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 10 I have now brought the first of the land’s produce that you, LORD, have given me. 

You will then place the container before the LORD your God and bow down to him. 11 You, the Levites, and the resident aliens among you will rejoice in all the good things the LORD your God has given you and your household.

That's a beautiful picture, to think of the Israelites re-telling their story when offering their sacrifice. It's a built-in reminder of all they have to be thankful for.

So, does that make Thanksgiving a Biblical holiday? 😁
