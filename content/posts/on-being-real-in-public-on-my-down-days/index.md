Sometimes, when I'm feeling down, I think it's okay to go out in public and not "emo dump" (as Charisse calls it). Rather, maybe it can be healing to push through real, but surface, emotions as I interact with others. In those cases, it's good to rejoice with them and invest in them. In fact, it can help take my mental focus off myself and instead focus on what God is doing in others. Not in a bad way that leads to envy, but in a positive way that reminds me of His goodness. 

It reminds me that he is still King and worthy of worship, regardless of my current emotions. I am still his kingdom subject - **which is a mercy and grace** - and he has not left me alone in my down day. 

That doesn't mean I should be fake and claim "everything is awesome today!" Those who know me best will still recognize my feelings anyway - since I am terrible at hiding them. But **I am free** to not spread my sadness to every person I encounter, without feeling as though I've been fake. 

Sometimes it is the role of the community and fellowship of the believers to mourn with those who mourn, but it is equally life giving to rejoice with those who rejoice.
