{{< bibleref reference="[Psalms 4.6-8 (ESV)](https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ps4.6-8)" >}}
6 There are many who say, “Who will show us some good? 
  Lift up the light of your face upon us, O LORD!” 
7 You have put more joy in my heart 
  than they have when their grain and wine abound. 
8 In peace I will both lie down and sleep; 
  for you alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.
